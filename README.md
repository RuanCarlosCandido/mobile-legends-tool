# mobileLegendsTool
An algorithm to suggest good counters heroes in ranked matches in the Mobile Legends game.

The highest known physical defense that can be ever obtained is 1380 (https://mobile-legends.fandom.com/wiki/Physical_defense),
so 8% of 1380 = 110, so the maximum that the tank emblem's fortress skill can increase in physical defense is 110 in a VERY rare situation
